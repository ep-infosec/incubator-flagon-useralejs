# Apache Flagon UseraALE.js React Example

This example was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It demonstrates UserALE.js `autostart` configurations and `start()`, `stop()` exports.

## Using this Example

To use this example, first install dependencies (from this subdir):

```Javascript
npm install
```

Then run the `start` script:

```Javascript
npm run start
```

This will start the React App in "developer mode", which will open in your browser.

Click the text on the page to execute the UserALE.js `start()` export and start logging behaviors.

Or, modify `App.js` in `src` to experiment with `autostart` and `stop()` exports.

Note that you will not receive logs unless you have a [logging server](https://github.com/apache/incubator-flagon-useralejs/tree/master/example#capturing-logs-using-the-logging-server) running.
